# daydreambelievers

Source code for [Daydream Believers](https://daydreambelievers.greenash.net.au/),
a site built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org/).

Based on the [tina-open-auth](https://github.com/kendallstrautman/tina-open-auth)
demo project. This repo follows the steps outlined in
[this guide](https://tinacms.org/guides/nextjs/github-open-authoring/initial-setup).

## Netlify

The live site is built by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Edit with Open Authoring

Head to the site and hit the 'Edit this Page' button in the top left-hand corner.
You will be prompted to authenticate with GitHub and create a fork. After that,
you'll be in ['Preview Mode'](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode)
and can edit the title via the Tina Sidebar. When you save, that content will be
committed to your fork.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates
as you edit the file.
